# Security Newsletter - July 2025

Welcome to the first edition of our AWS & Kubernetes Security Newsletter! In this monthly update, we'll cover the latest security developments, best practices, and tips for securing your cloud and container environments.

## Latest Security Vulnerabilities

### Critical Kubernetes Vulnerability Patched

A critical vulnerability in Kubernetes API server was patched this month. The vulnerability (CVE-2025-XXXX) could allow attackers to escalate privileges in certain configurations. Make sure to update your clusters to the latest version.

**Affected versions:** 1.28.x, 1.29.x
**Patched versions:** 1.28.15, 1.29.10

### AWS IAM Updates

AWS has introduced new security features for IAM, including enhanced anomaly detection and more granular permission boundaries. These features help prevent privilege escalation and detect unusual access patterns.

## Security Best Practice of the Month

### Implementing Pod Security Standards

Kubernetes Pod Security Standards provide a structured way to secure your workloads. Here's a quick implementation guide:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: secure-workloads
  labels:
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn: restricted
```

By applying these labels to your namespaces, you enforce the "restricted" policy which prevents pods from running with dangerous capabilities.

## Tool Spotlight: Trivy

[Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) is an excellent open-source vulnerability scanner for containers and Kubernetes. It can scan:

- Container images
- Filesystem
- Git repositories
- Kubernetes manifests

Basic usage:
```bash
# Scan a container image
trivy image nginx:latest

# Scan Kubernetes manifests
trivy config ./kubernetes-manifests/
```
