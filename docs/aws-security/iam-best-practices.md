# IAM Best Practices

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a fundamental service for securing your AWS environment. This guide covers best practices for managing identities and access in AWS.

## Identity Management

### User Management

- Create individual IAM users for each person requiring access
- Enforce strong password policies
- Require MFA for all users
- Regularly audit and remove inactive users

```bash
# Set a strong password policy
aws iam update-account-password-policy \
    --minimum-password-length 14 \
    --require-symbols \
    --require-numbers \
    --require-uppercase-characters \
    --require-lowercase-characters \
    --max-password-age 90 \
    --password-reuse-prevention 24
```

### Groups and Roles

- Organize users into IAM groups based on job functions
- Assign permissions to groups, not individual users
- Use IAM roles for applications running on EC2 instances
- Use roles for cross-account access

```bash
# Create a group for developers
aws iam create-group --group-name Developers

# Attach a policy to the group
aws iam attach-group-policy \
    --group-name Developers \
    --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/PowerUserAccess
```

## Access Management

### Least Privilege Principle

- Grant only the permissions needed to perform a task
- Start with minimal permissions and add as needed
- Use IAM Access Analyzer to identify unused permissions
- Regularly review and remove unnecessary permissions

### Permission Boundaries

- Use permission boundaries to set the maximum permissions for users
- Apply permission boundaries to users who can create IAM policies
- Combine with SCPs for comprehensive access control

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:*",
        "cloudwatch:*",
        "ec2:Describe*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": [
        "iam:*",
        "organizations:*",
        "kms:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Access Keys

### Managing Access Keys

- Avoid creating access keys for the root account
- Rotate access keys regularly (at least every 90 days)
- Remove unused access keys
- Don't embed access keys in code or share them

```bash
# Create a new access key
aws iam create-access-key --user-name johndoe

# List access keys for a user
aws iam list-access-keys --user-name johndoe

# Delete an access key
aws iam delete-access-key \
    --user-name johndoe \
    --access-key-id AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
```

### Using Temporary Credentials

- Use AWS STS to generate temporary credentials
- Implement AssumeRole operations for cross-account access
- Use instance profiles for EC2 instances

## Policy Management

### Policy Structure

- Use conditions to restrict when policies apply
- Specify resources explicitly in policy statements
- Use policy variables to make policies more dynamic
- Document the purpose of each policy

### Custom Policies vs. AWS Managed Policies

- Use AWS managed policies as a starting point
- Create custom policies for specific requirements
- Regularly review and update policies
- Use policy versioning to track changes

## Monitoring and Auditing

### IAM Reporting

- Generate credential reports regularly
- Use IAM Access Analyzer to identify external access
- Monitor IAM actions with CloudTrail
- Set up alerts for sensitive IAM operations

```bash
# Generate a credential report
aws iam generate-credential-report

# Get the credential report
aws iam get-credential-report
```

## Security Tools for IAM

- **IAM Access Analyzer**: Identifies resources shared with external entities
- **AWS Config**: Tracks IAM configuration changes
- **CloudTrail**: Logs all IAM API calls
- **Security Hub**: Provides IAM security best practice checks

## Common IAM Security Issues

1. **Overly permissive policies**: Granting more permissions than necessary
2. **Unused credentials**: Not removing access keys or users when no longer needed
3. **Lack of MFA**: Not requiring multi-factor authentication
4. **Embedded credentials**: Storing access keys in code repositories
5. **Inadequate rotation**: Not regularly rotating credentials

By following these IAM best practices, you can significantly improve the security posture of your AWS environment and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
