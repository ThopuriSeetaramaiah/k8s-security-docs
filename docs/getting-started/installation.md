# Installation Guide

This guide will help you install and set up the necessary tools for securing your Kubernetes clusters.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A running Kubernetes cluster (v1.19 or later recommended)
- `kubectl` CLI tool installed and configured to access your cluster
- Administrative access to your cluster
- Helm v3 installed (for certain security tools)

## Installing Essential Security Tools

### 1. kube-bench

kube-bench is a tool that checks whether Kubernetes is deployed according to security best practices as defined in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.

```bash
# Using kubectl
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench/main/job.yaml

# Check the results
kubectl logs job.batch/kube-bench
```

### 2. Trivy

Trivy is a comprehensive vulnerability scanner for containers.

```bash
# Install Trivy
brew install aquasecurity/trivy/trivy  # macOS
# or
apt-get install trivy  # Ubuntu/Debian

# Scan an image
trivy image nginx:latest
```

### 3. Falco

Falco is a cloud-native runtime security tool designed to detect anomalous activity in your applications.

```bash
# Add the Falco Helm repository
helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts
helm repo update

# Install Falco
helm install falco falcosecurity/falco --namespace falco --create-namespace
```

### 4. kube-hunter

kube-hunter hunts for security weaknesses in Kubernetes clusters.

```bash
# Run kube-hunter in a pod
kubectl run kube-hunter --restart=Never -it --rm --image aquasec/kube-hunter -- --pod
```

## Verifying Your Installation

After installing these tools, verify that they are working correctly:

1. Check that kube-bench completed successfully:
   ```bash
   kubectl get jobs | grep kube-bench
   ```

2. Verify Falco is running:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n falco
   ```

3. Test Trivy by scanning a container image:
   ```bash
   trivy image alpine:latest
   ```

## Next Steps

Now that you have installed the essential security tools, proceed to the [Quick Start Guide](quick-start) to implement basic security measures for your Kubernetes cluster.
