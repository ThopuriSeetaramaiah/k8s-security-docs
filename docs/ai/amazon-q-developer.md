```

Amazon Q will provide a complete implementation with appropriate error handling and best practices.

### Code Transformation

You can ask Amazon Q to transform code from one language to another:

function calculateTotal(items) {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
}
```

### Code Explanation

Amazon Q can explain complex code:

```
// Explain what this code does
const result = array.reduce((acc, curr) => {
  if (!acc[curr.category]) {
    acc[curr.category] = [];
  }
  acc[curr.category].push(curr);
  return acc;
}, {});
```

### Security Scanning

Amazon Q can identify security vulnerabilities in your code:

```
// Check this code for security issues
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${req.params.id}`;
  db.execute(query).then(user => res.json(user));
});
```

### AWS Service Integration

Amazon Q can help you work with AWS services:

```
// Write code to upload a file to S3 using AWS SDK for JavaScript
```

## Advanced Usage
