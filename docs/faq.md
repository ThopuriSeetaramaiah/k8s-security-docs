# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Kubernetes Security

### What is the most important security measure for Kubernetes?

There's no single "most important" measure, as Kubernetes security requires a defense-in-depth approach. However, implementing proper RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is often considered foundational, as it controls who can access your cluster and what actions they can perform.

### How do I know if my cluster is secure?

Regular security assessments are essential. Use tools like kube-bench to check against CIS benchmarks, kube-hunter to identify vulnerabilities, and conduct penetration testing. Also, implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities.

### Should I use a managed Kubernetes service or self-host?

Managed Kubernetes services (like EKS, GKE, AKS) handle many security aspects for you, such as control plane security and updates. For most organizations, especially those without dedicated Kubernetes expertise, managed services provide better security with less effort.

## Pod Security

### What is the difference between Pod Security Policies and Pod Security Standards?

Pod Security Policies (PSPs) were a Kubernetes feature that allowed cluster administrators to control security-sensitive aspects of pod specifications. They were deprecated in Kubernetes 1.21 and removed in 1.25.

Pod Security Standards (PSS) are the replacement, implemented through the Pod Security Admission Controller. They define three levels of security: Privileged, Baseline, and Restricted.

### Should containers run as root?

No, containers should run as non-root users whenever possible. Running as root increases the potential impact of vulnerabilities. Use the `runAsNonRoot: true` setting in your pod's security context.

### What is a distroless container image?

Distroless images contain only your application and its runtime dependencies, without package managers, shells, or other programs found in a standard Linux distribution. This reduces the attack surface significantly. Google provides distroless images for various languages.

## Network Security

### Do I need Network Policies if I'm using a service mesh?

Yes. While service meshes like Istio provide advanced traffic management and mTLS encryption, Network Policies operate at a different level and provide fundamental network segmentation. They complement each other rather than replace one another.

### How do I secure external traffic to my cluster?

Use an ingress controller with TLS termination, implement proper authentication and authorization, consider using a web application firewall (WAF), and limit the exposure of your services to only what's necessary.

### Can pods in different namespaces communicate by default?

Yes, by default, pods can communicate across namespace boundaries. To prevent this, you need to implement Network Policies that explicitly restrict cross-namespace communication.

## RBAC and Authentication

### What's the difference between authentication and authorization in Kubernetes?

Authentication verifies who you are (your identity), while authorization determines what you're allowed to do. Kubernetes uses various authentication methods (certificates, tokens, etc.) and RBAC for authorization.

### How should I manage service account tokens?

Limit the permissions of service accounts using RBAC, mount tokens only where needed, use short-lived tokens when possible, and consider using projected service account tokens with audience restrictions.

### What are some best practices for managing cluster access?

Implement the principle of least privilege, use short-lived credentials, implement just-in-time access, use strong authentication methods (preferably with MFA), and regularly audit access.

## Compliance and Standards

### Is Kubernetes PCI DSS compliant?

Kubernetes itself is not PCI DSS compliant or non-compliant; it's a tool that can be configured to be part of a PCI DSS compliant environment. You need to implement specific controls and configurations to meet PCI DSS requirements.

### How do I make my Kubernetes cluster HIPAA compliant?

HIPAA compliance requires encryption (both in transit and at rest), access controls, audit logging, and other security measures. Implement encryption for etcd, use TLS for all communications, implement strict RBAC, enable audit logging, and ensure proper network segmentation.

### What are CIS Benchmarks for Kubernetes?

The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks for Kubernetes are consensus-based configuration guidelines developed by security experts. They provide recommendations for securing your Kubernetes clusters. Tools like kube-bench can check your cluster against these benchmarks.

## Security Tools

### What tools should I use to scan container images?

Popular container scanning tools include:
- Trivy: A comprehensive vulnerability scanner
- Clair: An open-source project for static analysis of vulnerabilities in containers
- Anchore: A service that analyzes container images for vulnerabilities and policy compliance
- Docker Scan: Built into Docker CLI for scanning images

### How do I detect runtime security threats?

Use runtime security tools like:
- Falco: For detecting abnormal behavior and intrusions in applications
- Sysdig Secure: For runtime protection and forensics
- Aqua Security: For runtime protection of containers and hosts
- Cilium: For network-level threat detection with eBPF

### What's the difference between kube-bench and kube-hunter?

kube-bench checks your Kubernetes configuration against CIS benchmarks to identify misconfigurations, while kube-hunter actively searches for security weaknesses in your Kubernetes cluster, such as exposed ports, APIs, or services that could be exploited.
